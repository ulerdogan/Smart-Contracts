npm init -> creates a node project in a directory

Project Directory
    contracts               ---> directory that contains project contracts
        Inbox.sol
    test                    ---> testing the contract by Mocha code
        Inbox.test.js
    package.json            ---> dependecies about projecy
    compile.js              ---> to compile in the contracts directory codes
    deploy.js               ---> to take compile code into Ethereum blockchain
---

---
npm install --save solc            ---> installs solidity compiler into project directory

    npm uninstall solc                 ---> these 2 steps may be required to work in compatible version   
    npm install --save solc@0.4.25     ---> the required version to be applied in the course contents

prepare "compile.js" file

Bytecode --deploy-->    /-> Contract Instance in Ganache

npm install --save mocha ganache-cli web3@1.0.0-beta.35  ---> installing modules

prepare "Inbox.test.js" file

mocha functions:
    it ---> run a test and make an assertion
    describe ---> groups together "it" functions
    beforeEach ---> execute some general setup code

    changed "package.json"s test into "mocha"

    npm run test  ---> runs the mocha test and makes the return: pass or fail

a test try made with Car class example                      ---> on the last comments 

then a getAccounts test for ganache accounts by promises    ---> on the middle comments

and a getAccounts test for ganache accounts by async/await  ---> on main scope

we make tests

    interact with deployed contract needs ABI, address of the contract
    create a contract               needs ABI, bytecode

signed up for infura.io and get a Rinkeby API Key
    npm install --save truffle-hdwallet-provider
